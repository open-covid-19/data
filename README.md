# Open COVID-19 Dataset
This repository contains datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19, including
state/province epidemiology data for over 30 countries and county/municipality data for US, UK, NL
and CO.

The data is available as CSV and JSON files, which are published in Github Pages so they can be
served directly to Javascript applications without the need of a proxy to set the correct headers
for CORS and content type. Even if you only want the CSV files, using the URL served by Github Pages
is preferred in order to avoid caching issues and potential, future breaking changes.

For the purpose of making the data as easy to use as possible, there is a [master](#master) table
which contains the columns of all other tables joined by `key` and `date`. However,
performance-wise, it may be better to download the data separately and join the tables locally. The
datasets available from this project are:

If you are using this data, feel free to open an issue and let us know so we can give a call-out to
your project here.

## Use the data
Each table has a full version as well as subsets with only the last 30, 14, 7 and 1 days of data.
The full version is accessible at the URL described [in the table above](#open-covid-19-dataset).
The subsets can be found by appending the number of days to the path. For example, the subsets of
the master table are available at the following locations:
* Full version: https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/master.csv
* Last 30 days: https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/30/master.csv
* Last 14 days: https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/14/master.csv
* Last 7 days: https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/7/master.csv
* Latest: https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/latest/master.csv

Note that the `latest` version contains the last non-null record for each key, whereas all others
contain the last `N` days of data (all of which could be null for some keys).

If you are trying to use this data alongside your own datasets, then you can use the [Index](#index)
table to get access to the ISO 3166 / NUTS / FIPS code, although administrative subdivisions are
not consistent among all reporting regions. For example, for the intra-country reporting, some EU
countries use NUTS2, others NUTS3 and many ISO 3166-2 codes.

NOTE: If you load data using `pandas`, make sure that you disable automatic parsing of NaN-like
strings. Otherwise, the records for Namibia, which has country code `NA`, will be interpreted as a
`NaN` value instead of the literal string `"NA"`. See the [python](#python) example below for how to
set this option when reading CSV files.

You can find several examples in the [examples subfolder](examples) with code showcasing how to load
and analyze the data for several programming environments. If you want the short version, here are a
few snippets to get started.

### Google Colab
You can use Google Colab if you want to run your analysis without having to install anything in your
computer, simply go to this URL: https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-covid-19/data.

### R
If you prefer R, then this is all you need to do to load the epidemiology data:
```R
data <- read.csv("https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/master.csv")
```

### Python
In Python, you need to have the package `pandas` installed to get started:
```python
import pandas
data = pandas.read_csv("https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/master.csv")
```

### jQuery
Loading the JSON file using jQuery can be done directly from the output folder,
this code snippet loads all epidemiology data into the `data` variable:
```javascript
$.getJSON("https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/master.json", data => { ... }
```

### Powershell
You can also use Powershell to get the latest data for a country directly from
the command line, for example to query the latest data for Australia:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest 'https://open-covid-19.github.io/data/v2/master.csv' | ConvertFrom-Csv | `
    where Key -eq 'AU' | select country_name,total_confirmed,total_deceased,total_recovered
```

## Understand the data
Make sure that you are using the URL [linked at the table above](#open-covid-19-dataset) and not the
raw GitHub file, the latter is subject to change at any moment in non-compatible ways, and due to
the configuration of GitHub's raw file server you may run into potential caching issues.

Missing values will be represented as nulls, whereas zeroes are used when a true value of zero is
reported.

| **wikidata** | `string` | WikiData ID corresponding to this key | Q107146 |
| **country_code** | `string` | ISO 3166-1 alphanumeric 2-letter code of the country | US |
| **country_name** | `string` | American English name of the country, subject to change | United States of America |
| **subregion1_code** | `string` | (Optional) ISO 3166-2 or NUTS 2/3 code of the subregion | CA |

| **aggregation_level** | `integer` `[0-2]` | Level at which data is aggregated, i.e. country, state/province or county level | 2 |

### Demographics
Information related to the population demographics for each region:

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **key** | `string` | Unique string identifying the region | CN_HB |
| **population** | `integer` | Total count of humans living in the region | 58500000 |
| **life_expectancy** | `double` `[years]` |  Average years that an individual is expected to live | 70.944 |
| **human_development_index** | `double` `[0-1]` | Composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators | 0.773 |

### Economy
Information related to the economic development for each region:

| Name | Name | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **key** | `string` | Unique string identifying the region | CN_HB |
| **gdp** | `integer` `[USD]` | Gross domestic product; monetary value of all finished goods and services | 24450604878 |
| **gdp_per_capita** | `integer` `[USD]` | Gross domestic product divided by total population | 1148 |

### Epidemiology
Information related to the COVID-19 infections for each date-region pair:

| Name | Type | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| **date** | `string` | ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the datapoint | 2020-03-30 |
| **key** | `string` | Unique string identifying the region | CN_HB |
| **new_confirmed\*** | `integer` | Count of new cases confirmed after positive test on this date | 34 |
| **new_deceased\*** | `integer` | Count of new deaths from a positive COVID-19 case on this date | 2 |
| **new_recovered\*** | `integer` | Count of new recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case on this date | 13 |
| **total_confirmed\*\*** | `integer` | Cumulative sum of cases confirmed after positive test to date | 6447 |
| **total_deceased\*\*** | `integer` | Cumulative sum of deaths from a positive COVID-19 case to date | 133 |
| **total_recovered\*\*** | `integer` | Cumulative sum of recoveries from a positive COVID-19 case to date | 133 |

\*Values can be negative, typically indicating a correction or an adjustment in the way they were
measured. For example, a case might have been incorrectly flagged as recovered one date so it will
be subtracted from the following date.

\*\*Total count will not always amount to the sum of daily counts, because many authorities make
changes to criteria for counting cases, but not always make adjustments to the data. There is also
potential missing data. All of that makes the total counts *drift* away from the sum of all daily
counts over time, which is why the cumulative values, if reported, are kept in a separate column.

### Geography

### Notes about the data
For countries where both country-level and subregion-level data is available, the entry which has a
null value for the subregion level columns in the `index` table indicates upper-level aggregation.
For example, if a data point has values
`{country_code: US, subregion1_code: CA, subregion2_code: null, ...}` then that record will have
data aggregated at the subregion1 (i.e. state/province) level. If `subregion1_code`were null, then
it would be data aggregated at the country level.

Another way to tell the level of aggregation is the `aggregation_level` of the `index` table, see
the [schema documentation](#index) for more details about how to interpret it.

Please note that, sometimes, the country-level data and the region-level data come from different
sources so adding up all region-level values may not equal exactly to the reported country-level
value. See the [data loading tutorial][7] for more information.

There is also a [notices.csv](src/data/notices.csv) file which is manually updated with quirks about
the data. The goal is to be able to query by key and date, to get a list of applicable notices to
the requested subset.

### Backwards compatibility

## Why another dataset?
This dataset is heavily inspired by the dataset maintained by [Johns Hopkins University][1].
Unfortunately, that dataset has intermittently experienced maintenance issues and a lot of
applications depend on this critical data being available in a timely manner. Further, the true
sources of data for that dataset are still unclear and the methodology used to process the data has
not been made open sourced (at least at the time of this writing).

## Update the data
To update the contents of the [output folder](output), first install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following script from the source folder to update all datasets:
```sh
cd src
python run.py
```

See the [source documentation](src) for more technical details.
